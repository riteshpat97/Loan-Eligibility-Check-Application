## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a web application using Streamlit, which allows users to check their loan eligibility. The application predicts loan eligibility based on user inputs such as gender, marital status, monthly income, and loan amount. Additionally, Pyngrok is used to expose the local web server to the internet, and Google Colab is utilized for model training and development.

## Features
- Users can select their gender and marital status.
- Users can input their monthly income and desired loan amount.
- Upon clicking the "Check" button, the application predicts whether the loan will be approved or rejected.
- Pyngrok is integrated to expose the local Streamlit server to the internet, allowing for remote access to the application.
- Google Colab was used for model training and development, providing a collaborative environment for machine learning tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pyngrok
- Google Colab
